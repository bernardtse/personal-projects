## starwars-data-explorer
R Shiny App to Explore Star Wars Characters

**Overview:**

Star Wars Data Explorer an interactive Shiny app designed to allow users to explore and analyse various characteristics of Star Wars characters, including their species, sex, height and weight. The app provides several features such as visualising the relationship between height and weight, and conducting chi-squared tests to explore correlations among sex, height and weight.

This project aims to make Star Wars data more accessible and engaging through dynamic visualisations and statistical tests. By filtering the dataset based on species and analysing relationships, users can dive deeper into the characteristics of their favourite characters.
